Now you're laying asleep, content\\
with tamed eyes, absent from me\\
sheltered from me\\

they caressed your Hair\\
slipped the pill under your tongue\\
and whispered soft ``it's okay's''\\

windows are blurry with rain\\
glossing out construction cranes\\
--refracting the dying lights\\

The chairs were almost comfortable\\
and within their mutual angle\\
you only had to roll your eyes to\\
spray a distant stare\\

We used to have warm ashtrays\\
hot coffee,\\
cold feet; torn out socks\\
Scrambled eggs and ``fuck you weddings''\\[1ex]

they caressed your hair\\
Slipped the pill under your tongue\\'
and whispered soft it s okay's\\[1ex]

You  should wake up and forget\\
but you slept remembering\\[1ex]

they wear white coats\\
and indulgent airs\\[1ex]

I will wear guilt and satisfation\\
when you woke up and remembered\\
I went for a long walk and you never came?
