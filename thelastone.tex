the last one\\
can be hard to digest\\
you will play and ignore\\
a little, tym but always\\
remember why you came here\\
you had \textit{reasons} and\\
\textit{objectives}\\

can you at least\\
hum, tell me what they were\\
because to me it felt\\
like licking my paws\\
and strolling through\\
a different parallax\\

well first of all tym\\
you need to stop\\
hiding behind all those words\\
they will bite and hurt you back\\
those games are not meant to\\
be played by the score\\
otherwise you will crack\\
and the cats will come back
