as tym crosses the street\\
he saw two cars of different\\
shades pass by him\\
he waltzed and gave a hard\\
stare at the cat\\
peering over closed curtains\\
he couldn't choose\\
which one \\

so he strolled passed\\
to find some shade in\\
the orchard where knowledge\\
at least is not frowned upon\\
he found a place where windows\\
exist, however inside is still different\\
outside is colder and gray\\
you might catch a glimpse\\
but for that you need to choose your\\
waking ours\\

the difference is slim\\
it might be a slight wind draught\\
or the echo of a lover\\
tying your own shoelaces might\\
just be enough; velcro is for children\\
or so they said
