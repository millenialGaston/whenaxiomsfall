in the morning they found a naked \\
young man yelling\\
atop its breath\\
``i didnt want to i swear i swear'' \\
what are you talking about said the older man\\
``does it matter, i swear I didn't,
want to'', then why did \\
you; precisely what I'm trying to \\
figure out at last he cried in the dark\\[1ex]
can we talk at least\\[1ex]
well yes but i cant promise\\
I won't yell it into your ear\\
until your ear drums burst,\\
I'm just trying to release tears you see? \\
I can see through your blinded logical scaffolding's I\\
just wish I knew why you\\
are still looking for meaning where there is none\\

but wherelse am I supposed to look, we used to\\
we used to drive into sunsets holding hands and now\\
the sun rises on me but its lonely\\

I prefered to to shine with her\\
why aren't you with her then\\
but old man why don't you get\\
it is precisely what I'm trying to figure out\\
I still cry to marc ribot you see? why can't you\\
cause I sure as hell can't\\[1ex]
one day youll know young man,
well i know one thing\\
I know itll be too late\\
but at the very least it will be inside \& \\
you look tired of outdoors\\
in the night it was still the same old story untill an even older man asked the\\
even younger man ``why are you naked in the streets old sport''\\
I'm just looking for a mirror to spit into\\
and what do I look like says you \\
not a mirror I can tell you that much
