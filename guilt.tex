as the postman came back\\
guilty of forgetting the sweetest package\\
an old man was looking for photographed\\
guilts behind closed curtains\\
he should have looked under the couch\\
where our dreams lived
they haven't  died they simply\\
chose new names such as\\
lotion cream neons flashing lights\\
and the sweetest apathy brings it back\\
whatever it was\\

we have to look for them\\
they hide well\\
beneath guilt they haven't died\\
they chose incense and flowers\\
we chose vodka and unskimmed milk\\
as the postman licked his paws\\
I lectured him on hygiene\\
national geographic couldn't\\
have done it better for\\
it is objective
