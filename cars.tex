the waters are shallow\\
don't you know\\
you can't fly\\
the feeling only arises when loneliness\\
seems deeper than a single night without you\\
the insects stop buzzing our ears ache\\
the pools are not vast enough to get lost in\\
your eyes, deeper than I could ever imagine\\
still call at 3am a dead phone
all we ever needed was a car ride\\
past midnight when lights blur and rain can\\
choose its own direction\\
just another word for speed\\
her quick witted smile could tame\\
the wildest eyebrows\\
