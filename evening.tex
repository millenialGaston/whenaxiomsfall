evenings hit the hardest\\
when tym forgets at what time\\
the sun sets. He just waits for a shadow\\
a silhouette of himself. you were there\\
when it mattered I guess it doesn't\\
anymore;\\

actions are words when the\\
walls close in what else was tym left
with then words words and words\\
hinges don't have to hurt when\\
you fold your clothes; \& the day\\
was well spent\\

when it mattered I was chasing\\
instead of waiting, imitating --- \\
the tail never caught on to the trick\\
and now tym forgets the names of trees\\
