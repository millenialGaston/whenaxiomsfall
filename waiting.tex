pale blue wasn't supposed\\
to be our color; in the great\\
beauty of it all I still catch it\\
the myself looking at ceilings\\
looking for company\\

she came in like a tempest\\
left no room for apathy\\
which used to be sweet\\
it gave way to restlesness\\
where writing is for publishers\\
and tides only come in when the\\
horoscopes tell them so\\


tym never travelled enough\\
he preferred the confines of his own mind\\
choosing your prison is a problem of\\
semantics;\\
