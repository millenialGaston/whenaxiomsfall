I've been here before\\
where time loses its\\
own linear consistency\\
and wraps itself up in\\
new faded colors\\
vomiting a new me; where\\
life oscillates between heavyness\\
and loss of meaning\\
wishing it would just\\
make up its mind; where were you\\
when i was here; where I want to be\\
out in the world without loosing the thread of me\\
I'm scared, so scared of being insane\\
what's worse, sometimes it seems as if\\
sanity is just a stranger's bedroom\\
It shouldn't matter anyway If we\\
could just laugh it off, together.\\

I've been here before\\ev
and it was dark, with the\\
sharpest edges and no room to\\
just breathe and let the waves slowly ripple\\
and echo new variations on the same theme\\
now the melody is buried in anti-time space\\
in the great battles of before between harmony\\
and melody, which is it you preferred again\\
or were you able to sun kiss both before the horizons\\
fell into new hospitals\\

in the evening they found\\
an exhausted older man yelling atop\\
a building, what the hell is the point of all of this\\
if we can't just sleep at night, peacefully\\
and worry again in vigorous well established times\\
for thinking like 4pm or 11am
