when they arrived at\\
his parents house\\
the door was locked\\
so he had to force it\\
ever so gently; and yet it cracked\\
there was no going back\\
after she kissed him\\
he couldn't tell who had\\
made the first move\\
thinking comes later\\
when you wish for the woman
of your dreams\\
the first word he could\\
was \textit{fuck}; all the hair was soft\\
even the close shaven one was golden\\
and sweet; she slept with it and her\\
underwear was near enough\\
so as to forget the fault\\
